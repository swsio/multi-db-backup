## Introduction

This will build a container for backing up multiple type of DB Servers

Currently backs up CouchDB, InfluxDB, MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, Redis servers, MSSQL.

* dump to local filesystem or backup to S3 Compatible services
* select database user and password
* backup all databases
* choose to have an MD5 sum after backup for verification
* delete old backups after specific amount of time from filesystem or S3
* choose compression type (none, gz, bz, xz, zstd)
* connect to any container running on the same system of reachable by the container network
* select how often to run a dump
* select when to start the first dump, whether time of day or relative to container start time
* Execute script after backup for monitoring/alerting purposes

* This Container uses a standard [Alpine Linux base](https://github.com/alpinelinux/docker-alpine) custom enabled for PID 1 Init capabilities and running as non root user support for OpenShift/OKD

## Prerequisites

You must have a working DB server or container available for this to work properly, it does not provide server functionality!

## Installation

Automated builds of the image are available at [Quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/agileio/multi-db-backup)

### Currently available tags
- latest
- v1.1

### Get it from shell
```bash
docker pull quay.io/agileio/multi-db-backup:latest
```

### Quick Start

* Run desired image in your environment (Docker, OpenShift, K8S,...)
* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabiltiies of this image.
* Map [persistent storage](#data-volumes) for access to configuration and data files for backup.

> **NOTE**: If you are using this with a docker-compose file along with a seperate SQL container, take care not to set the variables to backup immediately, more so have it delay execution for a minute, otherwise you will get a failed first backup.

## Configuration

### Data-Volumes

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory                | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/backup`                | Backups                                                                            |
| `/tmp/backup`            | Temp space for backups                                                             |
| `/assets/custom-scripts` | *Optional* Put custom scripts in this directory to execute after backup operations |

### Environment Variables

**Backing Up to S3 Compatible Services**

If `BACKUP_LOCATION` = `S3` then the following options are used.

| Parameter       | Description                                                                             |

| `S3_BUCKET`     | S3 Bucket name e.g. 'mybucket'                                                          |
| `S3_HOST`       | Hostname of S3 Server e.g "s3.amazonaws.com" - You can also include a port if necessary |
| `S3_KEY_ID`     | S3 Access Key                                                                              |
| `S3_KEY_SECRET` | S3 Secret Key                                                                           |
| `S3_PATH`       | S3 Pathname to save to e.g. '`backup`'                                                  |
| `S3_PROTOCOL`   | Use either `http` or `https` to access service - Default `https`                        |
| `S3_URI_STYLE`  | Choose either `VIRTUALHOST` or `PATH` style - Default `VIRTUALHOST`                     |

## Maintenance

Manual Backups can be performed by entering the container and typing `backup-now`
- Cleanup will also be performed if set

### Shell Access

For debugging and maintenance purposes you may want access the containers shell.

```bash
docker exec -it (whatever your container name is e.g.) db-backup bash
```

#### Custom Scripts

If you want to execute a custom script at the end of backup, you can drop bash scripts with the extension of `.sh` in this directory. See the following example to utilize delivered variables:

````bash
$ cat post-script.sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

## Example Post Script
## $1=EXIT_CODE (After running backup routine)
## $2=DB_TYPE (Type of Backup)
## $3=DB_HOST (Backup Host)
## #4=DB_NAME (Name of Database backed up
## $5=DATE (Date of Backup)
## $6=TIME (Time of Backup)
## $7=BACKUP_FILENAME (Filename of Backup)
## $8=FILESIZE (Filesize of backup)
## $9=MD5_RESULT (MD5Sum if enabled)

echo "${1} ${2} Backup Completed on ${3} for ${4} on ${5} ${6}. Filename: ${7} Size: ${8} bytes MD5: ${9}"
````

Outputs the following on the console:

`0 mysql Backup Completed on example-db for example on 2020-04-22 05:19:10. Filename: mysql_example_example-db_20200422-051910.sql.bz2 Size: 7795 bytes MD5: 952fbaafa30437494fdf3989a662cd40`

If you wish to change the size value from bytes to megabytes set environment variable `SIZE_VALUE=megabytes`

#### NOTE
You can only use features available in the container image an running as non root with unprivileged capabilities
